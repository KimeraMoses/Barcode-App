# Head Count Barcode Application UI/UX

# Project Details

Head Count is project that was assigned to me by [Isaac Mubiru](https://github.com/zac-09), my role was to implement the UI from the Xd mockup and Add logic to the UI to make it fully functional.
The application is built in Reactjs,Redux, React Router v6.

## Client's Requirements

The tasks are as follows:

1. Responsive UI and cross-browser page compatibility
2. Testing and Debugging
3. Documentation (Readme)

# Features

> Mobie Responsiveness:
> We had a task of making sure that the web pages are made responsive on different device widths

> Semantic tags:
> Use of the know semantic tags was also a checkpoint during the project, making sure that we used only tags that were neccessary.

> Beautiful UI and UX âœ¨:
> Bringing out the webpages as they appear in the mockup was the major goal of this task.

> Adding Logic and Making API Calls:
> After the UI implementation, i had to add logic to the UIs making different calls and storing data in redux and passing it on to the different components where it had to be displayed. It was such an awesome experience getting to learn how to connect to metamask extension and capturing the account address to use it when making calls for different transactions.
